                    <p>
                        I developed a robust golf tracking app that allows users to input their scores and monitor their performance over time.
                        The app features a MongoDB backend for persistent data storage, ensuring that users can reliably save and retrieve
                        their golf statistics. On the server-side, I used Node.js to handle the application logic, while React Native was employed
                        to create a responsive and intuitive mobile interface. This seamless combination of technologies provides a smooth user
                        experience across various devices, enabling golfers to keep track of their progress anytime, anywhere.

                        Here's an essay about meeeee: a passionate tech enthusiast and a lifelong learner.
                        My journey in the world of technology began with a curiosity for how things work, starting with building and programming LEGO FLL robots from as early as 6 years old and later advancing to VEX robots in high school. 
                        These early experiences ignited my love for robotics and coding, shaping my path into the exciting world of technology. 
                        Whether it's building innovative web applications or diving into the intricacies of software development, I learn new things with every line of code I write.
                        But there's more to me than just technology!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I'm not glued to my screen, you'll often find me on the golf course, perfecting my swing as part of my high school varsity golf team. 
                        Golfing has taught me the importance of patience, precision, and perseverance‚Äîqualities I bring to my coding projects as well. 
                        I'm also an avid reader, always on the hunt for my next great read. Books have a special place in my heart, and I believe they offer a unique way to explore new ideas and perspectives. 
                        From diving into the latest tech trends to getting lost in a good novel, my love for reading fuels my creativity and keeps my mind sharp.
                        In this website, you'll get a glimpse into my world, where I blend my technical skills with my personal passions. I‚Äôm excited to share my projects, hobbies, and the things that inspire me with you!
