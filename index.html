                    <p>
                        Hi there! I'm Twisha Sharma, a passionate tech enthusiast and a lifelong learner. 
                        My journey in the world of technology began with a curiosity for how things work, starting with building and programming LEGO FLL robots from as early as 6 years old and later advancing to VEX robots in high school. 
                        These early experiences ignited my love for robotics and coding, shaping my path into the exciting world of technology. 
                        Whether it's building innovative web applications or diving into the intricacies of software development, I learn new things with every line of code I write.
                        But there's more to me than just technology!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I'm not glued to my screen, you'll often find me on the golf course, perfecting my swing as part of my high school varsity golf team. 
                        Golfing has taught me the importance of patience, precision, and perseverance—qualities I bring to my coding projects as well. 
                        I'm also an avid reader, always on the hunt for my next great read. Books have a special place in my heart, and I believe they offer a unique way to explore new ideas and perspectives. 
                        From diving into the latest tech trends to getting lost in a good novel, my love for reading fuels my creativity and keeps my mind sharp.
                        In this website, you'll get a glimpse into my world, where I blend my technical skills with my personal passions. I’m excited to share my projects, hobbies, and the things that inspire me with you!

                        Many of these projects were developed through university classes, where I was able to apply academic knowledge to real-world problems. 
                        Others, however, were created purely out of my own interest and passion for technology. The combination of formal education and self-motivated
                        learning has allowed me to continually grow as a developer and explore various fields within software engineering.

                    <p>
                        I developed a robust golf tracking app that allows users to input their scores and monitor their performance over time.
                        The app features a MongoDB backend for persistent data storage, ensuring that users can reliably save and retrieve
                        their golf statistics. On the server-side, I used Node.js to handle the application logic, while React Native was employed
                        to create a responsive and intuitive mobile interface. This seamless combination of technologies provides a smooth user
                        experience across various devices, enabling golfers to keep track of their progress anytime, anywhere.

                    <p>
                        Collaborating with a team of friends, I played a key role in developing Yap, a dynamic messaging application.
                        My contributions focused on designing and implementing the front-end login page, ensuring it was both user-friendly
                        and visually appealing. I utilized React to build the interactive interface, while the backend was powered by Node.js
                        and Express. This integration allowed for efficient user authentication and management, providing a secure and streamlined
                        user experience. Yap is a testament to my ability to work effectively in a team and deliver a polished product.

                    <p> 
                        I implemented a Web Proxy Server capable of accepting client requests and converting them to HTTPS for secure communication
                        with web servers. This project involved in-depth understanding of network protocols and secure data transmission,
                        providing a crucial learning experience in system-level programming with C. The server ensures secure and efficient
                        data exchange, highlighting my skills in network security and low-level programming.

                    <p>
                        In this project, I developed a multi-subnet network topology for a simulated company environment. Using Mininet,
                        I integrated switches and routers to create a network architecture that segmented different departments using VLANs
                        (Virtual Local Area Networks). This setup ensured network isolation and security, reflecting my proficiency in network
                        architecture and Python scripting. The project demonstrates my ability to design and implement complex networking
                        solutions tailored to specific organizational needs.

                    <p>
                        I developed a client-server file echo application using the UDP protocol in a UNIX environment. This application featured
                        a custom protocol for splitting files into MTU-sized packets, ensuring reliable file transfer over the network. The project
                        enhanced my understanding of network protocols, particularly UDP, and showcased my skills in handling low-level data
                        transmission tasks in C.
